              Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical
              locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train,
              boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage,
              and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include
              relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the
              case of tourism.
            </p>

              There are 195 countries in the world today. This total comprises
              193 countries that are member states of the United Nations and 2
              countries that are non-member observer states: the Holy See and
              the State of Palestine.

              The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North
              America, with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the
              nation’s presence into the Pacific Ocean. Major Atlantic Coast
              cities are New York, a global finance and culture center, and
              capital Washington, DC. Midwestern metropolis Chicago is known for
              influential architecture and on the west coast, Los Angeles'
              Hollywood is famed for filmmaking.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, from coastlines to big cities, the United States is made
              up of so many diverse destinations that it's hard to decide which
              places deserve the distinction of the best in America.

              <strong>
                Before you travel, consider the following

                <em>Is COVID-19 spreading at your destination?</em> <br />
                The more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to
                get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when
                you return.

                If you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to
                loved ones when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms.

                Anyone can get very ill from the virus that causes COVID-19, but
                older adults and people of any age with certain underlying
                medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from
                COVID-19.

                </em>
                <br />
                Some state, local, and territorial governments have
                requirements, such as requiring people to wear masks and
                requiring those who recently traveled to stay home for up to 14
                days. Check state, territorial, tribal and local public health
                websites for information before you travel. If you are traveling
                internationally, check the destination’s Office of Foreign
                Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State,
                Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal
                icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for
                arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine.
