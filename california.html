              California, a western U.S. state, stretches from the Mexican
              border along the Pacific for nearly 900 miles. Its terrain
              includes cliff-lined beaches, redwood forest, the Sierra Nevada
              Mountains, Central Valley farmland and the Mojave Desert. The city
              of Los Angeles is the seat of the Hollywood entertainment
              industry. Hilly San Francisco is known for the Golden Gate Bridge,
              Alcatraz Island and cable cars.

              Boulevard, TCL Chinese Theatre displays celebrities’ hand- and
              footprints, the Walk of Fame honors thousands of luminaries and
              vendors sell maps to stars’ homes.

              Santa Catalina, one of California’s Channel Islands, lies
              southwest of Los Angeles. It's known for its wildlife, dive sites
              and Mt. Orizaba, its highest peak. The resort town of Two Harbors
              lies to the north. To the south, in the city of Avalon, palm trees
              and cabanas line Descanso Beach. Avalon’s circular, art deco
              Catalina Casino is a cultural center with a movie theater,
              ballroom and museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visiting to Catalina Island is not as cheap as visiting to other
              places in California. Because you need a ticket to go to the
              island. Then you need to buy tickets for everything in the island.

              Yosemite Falls are popular with visitors from around the world.
              Much of the water that crashes down the falls and into the lake
              below comes from snowmelt. Yosemite falls itself is the fifth
              highest waterfall in the world and from top to bottom it is 2,425
              feet. The falls are at their most spectacular in May and June,
              once the snow has melted the falls become a trickle and you then
              need to wait for the cooler weather again.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes more than one day to visit the whole park. There are many
              camping and lodging options available. A ticket is need to enter.
              The highest price of the ticket is $33.00.

              Lake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada
              Mountains, straddling the border of California and Nevada. It’s
              known for its beaches and ski resorts. On the southwest shore,
              Emerald Bay State Park contains the 1929 Nordic-style mansion
              Vikingsholm. Along the lake’s northeast side, Lake Tahoe Nevada
              State Park includes Sand Harbor Beach and Spooner Lake, a gateway
              to the long-distance Tahoe Rim Trail.
            </p>
