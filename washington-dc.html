              Washington, DC, the U.S. capital, is a compact city on the Potomac
              River, bordering the states of Maryland and Virginia. It’s defined
              by imposing neoclassical monuments and buildings – including the
              iconic ones that house the federal government’s 3 branches: the
              Capitol, White House and Supreme Court. It's also home to iconic
              museums and performing-arts venues such as the Kennedy Center.

              The White House is the official residence and workplace of the
              president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania
              Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every
              U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.
            </p>
            <p>
              The White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside
              surface. At various times in history, the White House has been
              known as the “President’s Palace,” the “President’s House,” and
              the “Executive Mansion. People from different countries come to

              Rock Creek Park is a large urban park that bisects the Northwest
              quadrant of Washington, D.C. The park was created by an Act of
              Congress in 1890 and today is administered by the National Park
              Service. Great place for nature lovers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 1,754 acre city park was officially authorized in 1890,
              making it the third national park to be designated by the federal
              government. It offers visitors the opportunity to escape the
              bustle of the city and find a peaceful refuge, recreation, fresh
              air, majestic trees, wild animals, and thousands of years of human
              history.
